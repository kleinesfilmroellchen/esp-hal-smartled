//! Allows for the use of an RMT output channel on the ESP32 family to easily drive smart RGB LEDs. This is a driver for the [smart-leds](https://crates.io/crates/smart-leds) framework and allows using the utility functions from this crate as well as higher-level libraries based on smart-leds.
//!
//! Different from [ws2812-esp32-rmt-driver](https://crates.io/crates/ws2812-esp32-rmt-driver), which is based on the unofficial `esp-idf` SDK, this crate is based on the official no-std [esp-hal](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal).
//!
//! This driver uses the blocking RMT API, which is not suitable for use in async code. The [`SmartLedsWrite`] trait is implemented for [`SmartLedsAdapter`] only if a [`Blocking`] RMT channel is passed.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! let rmt = Rmt::new(peripherals.RMT, Rate::from_mhz(80)).unwrap();
//!
//! let mut led = SmartLedsAdapter::<{ buffer_size(1) }, _, color_order::Rgb, Ws2812Timing>::new(
//!     rmt.channel0, peripherals.GPIO2
//! );
//!
//! led.write(brightness([RED], 10)).unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! ## Usage overview
//!
//! The [`SmartLedsAdapter`] struct implements [`SmartLedsWrite`]
//! and can be used to send color data to connected LEDs
//! To initialize a [`SmartLedsAdapter`], use [`SmartLedsAdapter::new`],
//! which takes an RMT channel and a [`PeripheralOutput`].
//! If you want to reuse the channel afterwards, you can use [`esp_hal::rmt::ChannelCreator::reborrow`] to create a shorter-lived derived channel.
//! [`SmartLedsAdapter`] is configured at compile-time to support a variety of LED configurations. See the documentation for [`SmartLedsAdapter`] for more info.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! None of the features provided by this crate are for external use, they are only used for testing and examples.

/// [`SmartLedsWrite`] driver implementation using the ESP32’s “remote control” (RMT) peripheral for hardware-offloaded, fast control of smart LEDs.
///
/// For usage examples and a general overview see [the crate documentation](`crate`).
///
/// This type supports many configurations of color order, LED timings, and LED count. For this reason, there are three main type parameters you have to choose:
/// - The buffer size. This determines how many RMT pulses can be sent by this driver, and allows it to function entirely without heap allocation. It is strongly recommended to use the [`buffer_size`] function with the desired number of LEDs to choose a correct buffer size, otherwise [`SmartLedsWrite::write`] will return [`AdapterError::BufferSizeExceeded`].
/// - The [`ColorOrder`]. This determines what order the LED expects the color values in. Almost all LEDs use [`color_order::Rgb`] or [`color_order::Grb`].
/// - The [`Timing`]. This determines the smart LED type in use; what kind of signal it expects. Several implementations for common LED types like WS2812 are provided. Note that many WS2812-like LEDs are at least almost compatible in their timing, even though the datasheets specify different amounts, the other LEDs’ values are within the tolerance range, and even exceeding these, many LEDs continue to work beyond their specified timing range. It is however recommended to use the corresponding LED type, or implement your own when needed.
///
/// When the driver move is [`Blocking`], this type implements the blocking [`SmartLedsWrite`] interface. An async interface for [`esp_hal::Async`] may be added in the future. (You usually don’t need to choose this manually, Rust can deduce it from the passed-in RMT channel.)
